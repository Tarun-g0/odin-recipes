        <h2>How to prepare</h2>
        <ul>
            <h3><li>step 1</li></h3>
            <p>Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).</p>
            <h3><li>step 2</li></h3>
            <p>Place cracker crumbs and eggs into 2 separate shallow bowls. Mix cracker crumbs with
                 garlic salt and pepper.</p>
            <h3><li>step 3</li></h3>
            <p>Dip chicken in eggs, then dredge in crumb mixture to coat. Arrange coated chicken in
                 a 9x13-inch baking dish. Scatter butter around chicken.</p>
            <h3><li>step 4</li></h3>
            <p>Bake in the preheated oven until chicken is no longer pink in the center and the
                 juices run clear, about 40 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the
                  center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).</p>
